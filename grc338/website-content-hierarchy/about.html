      <h3>Welcome to Sweet Cheeks Baking Company</h3>
      <p>Founders Mary Odson and Lisa Ritter openedSweet Cheeks Baking Company in 2006 with the desire to become a friendly neighborhood bakery specializing in American-style baked goods and custom cakes.</p>
      <p>We continue the tradition today by offering childhood favorites and custom cake designs which we bake from scratch using the finest ingredients. We still crack cage-free eggs, use pure vanilla extract, imported chocolate from Belgium and France and yes, you most definitely taste the difference.</p>
      <p>In 2014, we opened a second store in downtown Los Angeles. We have an incredible team of cake artists whose designs are frequently displayed on our Instagram page.</p>
      <p>It has truly been an honor to be part of our customersâ€™ celebrations by supplying dessert or a special cake. From baby showers to weddings, everything is made with love and attention to detail. Thank you for all the wonderful years and memories.</p>
