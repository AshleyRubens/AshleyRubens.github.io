    <h2>Our Story</h2>
	<div>
		<p>Founders Mary Odson and Lisa Ritter opened Sweet Cheeks Baking Company in 2006 with the desire to become a friendly neighborhood bakery specializing in American-style baked goods and custom cakes.</p>
		<p>We continue the tradition today by offering childhood favorites and custom cake designs which we bake from scratch using the finest ingredients. We still crack cage-free eggs, use pure vanilla extract, imported chocolate from Belgium and France and yes, you most definitely taste the difference. It has truly been an honor to be part of our customersâ€™ celebrations by supplying dessert or a special cake. From baby showers to weddings, everything is made with love and attention to detail. Thank you for all the wonderful years and memories.</p>
